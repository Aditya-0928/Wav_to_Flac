Project Overview
The WAV to FLAC Converter is a Go-based service that allows users to upload WAV files through a WebSocket connection and receive a FLAC file in return. This service could be integrated into larger audio processing systems where lossless audio compression is needed. FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) compresses audio files while preserving audio quality, making it a suitable format for storage and distribution.

Key Features
Converts WAV audio files to FLAC format.
Real-time conversion via WebSocket connections.
Modular design with separate modules for conversion, WebSocket handling, and logging.
Project Structure
This is the basic architecture of the project:

audio/
converter.go: Contains the logic for converting WAV files to FLAC.
handlers/
websocket.go: Manages WebSocket connections and handles file upload and download through the WebSocket interface.
tests/
converter_test.go: Unit tests for the audio conversion functionality.
websocket_test.go: Unit tests for the WebSocket functionality.
utils/
logger.go: Provides logging functionality for the application.
convert_to_base64.py: A Python helper script for testing, which converts audio files to Base64 format.
save.py: (Assumed) A script for saving files after conversion.
main.go: The entry point of the application.
output.flac: Sample output file generated after conversion.
Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:

Go (1.16 or later)
FFmpeg (for audio format conversion if required)
Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wav-to-flac-converter
cd wav-to-flac-converter
Initialize Go modules:

bash
Copy code
go mod tidy
(Optional) Install Python dependencies if needed for convert_to_base64.py:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To start the WebSocket server:

bash
Copy code
go run main.go
This will start a WebSocket server that listens for incoming connections to process WAV to FLAC conversions.

Sending a WAV File via WebSocket
To send a WAV file for conversion:

Establish a WebSocket connection with the server.
Send the WAV file data through the WebSocket.
The server will process the file and return a FLAC file through the WebSocket connection.
API Usage
The WebSocket API allows clients to upload WAV files and receive FLAC files in real time.

Connect to WebSocket
Endpoint: ws://localhost:8080/convert
Send WAV File
Send the WAV file as binary data through the WebSocket.
Receive FLAC File
The server responds with the converted FLAC file as binary data.
Example WebSocket Client
Hereâ€™s a sample WebSocket client code in Python:

python
Copy code
import websocket
import base64

# Connect to WebSocket
ws = websocket.WebSocket()
ws.connect("ws://localhost:8080/convert")

# Read WAV file and encode to Base64
with open("input.wav", "rb") as wav_file:
    wav_data = wav_file.read()
    ws.send_binary(wav_data)

# Receive FLAC file data and save it
flac_data = ws.recv()
with open("output.flac", "wb") as flac_file:
    flac_file.write(flac_data)

print("Received FLAC file saved as output.flac")
ws.close()
Testing
Unit tests for this project are located in the tests/ directory. To run the tests, use the following command:

bash
Copy code
go test ./tests/...
This will run the unit tests for both the audio conversion functionality and the WebSocket handling.

Deployment
This application can be deployed on any platform supporting Go. To deploy:

Compile the Go application:

bash
Copy code
go build -o wav-to-flac
Run the executable:

bash
Copy code
./wav-to-flac
